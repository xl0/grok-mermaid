 * - `text`       node / participant / compartment labels
 * - `edge`       connector lines and arrowheads
 * - `edgeLabel`  text sitting on an edge
 * - `title`      the `mermaid: <kind>` header of a source box
 * - `none`       blank filler

/**
 * A rendered diagram. `plain[i]` and `styled[i]` describe the same row:
 * `plain` is right-trimmed for display width and copy/paste, `styled` keeps
 * the run structure needed to colour it.
 *
 * `width` is the display columns the widest row needs — the number to compare
 * against the space you have. It cannot be recovered from `plain`, whose rows
 * are strings of code points, not columns.
 *
 * `classDefs` are the diagram's `classDef` declarations, parsed:
 * `classDef warning fill:#f96,stroke:#333` becomes
 * `{ warning: { fill: '#f96', stroke: '#333' } }`. The renderer ignores them;
 * a consumer can map them onto its own styling of the classes spans carry.
 *
 * `warnings` lists source the grammar could not read and dropped, and any
 * size-cap truncation. Non-empty means the art is real but incomplete — some
 * of what was written is not in it.
 *
 * They are advisory. Do not gate rendering on them: the art is the best drawing
 * of the source either way, and a diagram being typed or streamed warns at
 * nearly every intermediate state. Show them alongside, or once it settles.
