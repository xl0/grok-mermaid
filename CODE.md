# Code

`lovely-mermaid` (formerly `grok-mermaid`): a terminal Mermaid renderer in
TypeScript. Started as a 1:1 port of `xai-org/grok-build`
(`crates/codegen/xai-grok-markdown/src/mermaid.rs`, ~3.6k lines; reference
checkout: `~/.cache/checkouts/github.com/xai-org/grok-build`), now deliberately
diverging where terminal output can be better. Review docs are episodic and
deleted once executed (`REDESIGN.md`, `REWORK.md` — in git history);
`REVIEW.md` is the current one, kept local and untracked.

Adding a diagram type is one module in `diagrams/` plus one `DIAGRAMS` entry:
the module owns its header keywords (`headers`), parser and layout glue, and
the registry derives both `diagramKind` and `render` dispatch from the same
table, so the header test a parser gates on and the one `diagramKind` reports
cannot drift apart.

`docs/demo.svg` paints real `render()` output through a theme, which a markdown
code fence cannot do — it is the only way to show what `Role` buys. Its line
height is one em on purpose: box-drawing glyphs span at least that, so rows
overlap rather than gap in whatever font the viewer has.

The README lives at the repo root (so GitHub renders it — a symlink would
not) and is the one full copy; the package `build` script copies it into
`packages/lovely-mermaid/` for npm, where the copy is gitignored.

`docs/streaming.gif` is a screen recording, GIF rather than MP4 because npm's
README renderer strips `<video>`. Both assets are referenced by absolute
`raw.githubusercontent.com` URL (under `packages/lovely-mermaid/docs/`): npm
rewrites *relative* paths inconsistently for HTML `<img>`, and the README has
to render on npm as well as GitHub. Regenerate from a recording with:

```sh
ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -vf "fps=12,scale=900:-1:flags=lanczos,split[a][b];\
[a]palettegen=stats_mode=diff:max_colors=64[p];\
[b][p]paletteuse=dither=bayer:bayer_scale=5:diff_mode=rectangle" \
  -loop 0 docs/streaming.gif
```

Frame count dominates the size, not the palette — dropping to 32 colours saves
under 10%, so fps and width are the knobs worth turning.

## Public API

`render(src)` returns `{ plain, styled, width, classDefs, warnings }`, or
`null` when there is no art to show: blank input, an unsupported grammar, a
source in which not one statement parsed, or a diagram whose layout exceeds
the canvas cell cap. `sourceBox(src, maxWidth?)` frames the source in a titled
box. `diagramKind(src)` reads the header alone, so a caller can tell a
malformed diagram from one this renderer never draws.

**Width is reported, not enforced.** Layout takes no limit and never substitutes
the source box for art. Nothing in a diagram says whether an over-wide one
should be shrunk, scrolled, linked to an image or simply printed, so `width` is
the answer and the response is the caller's:

```ts
const art = render(src)
show(art && art.width <= cols ? art : sourceBox(src, cols))
```

`width` is the widest *painted* row, which is what a caller can act on — it
cannot be recovered from `plain`, whose rows are strings of code points rather
than columns.

Both entry points take untrusted source, so both apply `stripControls`.

`plain[i]` and `styled[i]` are the same row, and `styled[i]` joined is exactly
`plain[i]` — enforced by `test/spans.test.ts` across a corpus of every diagram
type plus a source box. Rendered diagrams omit empty rows before the first and
after the last painted row.

**Roles vs classes.** `Span.role` is semantic and renderer-decided
(`border`/`text`/`edge`/`edgeLabel`/`title`/`none`), never a colour: layout
does not depend on the theme, so a render survives a theme change and is plain
JSON, hence worker-transferable. `Span.classes` is author-assigned — `:::name`
or `class A,B name` — carried by every cell the classed node paints, including
blank box interior (so a consumer can fill the box). `art.classDefs` holds the
parsed `classDef` declarations (`name -> {prop: value}`), uninterpreted by
the renderer. `class-style.ts` interprets them best-effort for a cell grid:
`resolveClassStyle` merges a span's classes into `{fill, stroke, color,
bold}` (hex/`rgb()`/common named colors normalized to `#rrggbb`; other props
ignored), `contrastOn` picks the black/white foreground for a fill with no
declared color. `toAnsi` applies that over the role theme (`classSgr` →
truecolor SGR); a style that colors nothing for a role (bold-only) merges
with the theme SGR instead of replacing it. Consumers with their own
styling model use the same resolver against `styled` + `classDefs`; the
demo just calls `toAnsi`.
`Span.href` rides the same per-cell mechanism as classes: `click A "url"`
(flowchart) / `link A "url"` (class) set `Node.href`, every cell the node
paints carries it, and `toAnsi` wraps those runs in OSC 8 hyperlinks.
Callback forms (`call`/`callback`) are ignored — their quoted string is a
tooltip, not a target.
Class assignment is parsed in every grammar that has it:
flowchart `:::` at the node cursor, state/class `:::` inline at each id token
(`takeTags`; a tag inside a quoted label or description is text, not a tag),
and `class A,B name` statements in flowchart/state/class — plus class-diagram
`cssClass "A,B" name` — via `parseClassAssign` + `Graph.applyClasses`,
deferred so a statement may precede the nodes it names. classDefs parse in
flowchart/state/class diagrams.

**Shared scan helpers** (`statements.ts`) are the one place quote rules live:
`splitTop` (split outside quotes and parens — classDef props, at-shape pairs,
ER tokens), `quoteMask` (class-relation operator scan), `splitColon` (label
colon that skips `:::` runs), `takeTags`. A grammar reinventing one of these
is how the quoted-cardinality and `rgb()` bugs happened; don't.

Mermaid YAML frontmatter (`---` … `---` before the header) is skipped by
`statementsOf`; `frontmatterTitle` reads its `title:`, which `render` paints
above the art. While unterminated, everything is frontmatter — a streamed
diagram stays blank until the block closes.

## Syntax errors

**Every grammar is lenient; caps truncate.** The library rule: render as much
as possible, report what was lost in `warnings`.

- Flowchart keeps the parseable *prefix of a statement* (inherited from
  upstream and mermaid.js): `A[Start --> B` renders one box labelled
  `Start --> B` with a warning naming the unterminated bracket. The three
  `break`/`return` sites in `parseStatement` and `readShape`'s
  running-off-the-end each warn.
- State, class, ER and sequence drop an unreadable *statement* whole
  (`dropped, unreadable statement: "…"`) and keep going. Statements in these
  grammars are independent, so a drop cannot corrupt its neighbours. Block
  delimiters are handled structurally first: a bad `class X {` / entity `{`
  declaration swallows its whole body (`'skip'` sentinel), since reading the
  members as top-level statements would misparse everything inside.
- Size caps truncate: `MAX_NODES`/`MAX_EDGES` (and the flowchart subgraph
  caps) stop the parse, render the prefix, and warn
  `diagram truncated: <cap> reached`. Rationale: streaming — a growing diagram
  can never un-cap, so the old refusal flipped it to the source box forever;
  the truncated prefix is stable because appending never changes it. Cost is
  bounded by construction: the capped prefix is exactly the largest legal
  diagram. `MAX_CANVAS_CELLS` stays fatal (`null`) — it is discovered after
  layout ran and there is no partial canvas to show.
- `null` still means "nothing there": no recognised header, zero nodes /
  participants after parsing, or the cell cap. Prose that happens to start
  with `sequenceDiagram` refuses; warnings never substitute for having parsed
  something.

This replaced the earlier salvage retry (one attempt without the final line):
per-statement dropping subsumes it, and `attempt` in `index.ts` is gone.
Streaming needs no caller ceremony either way.

**Warnings are advisory and must not gate rendering.** A source being streamed
warns at nearly every intermediate state — a label bracket is unterminated
right up until it is typed.

Headers are matched exactly (`headers` lists in each diagram module):
upstream's `starts_with` accepts `stateDiagramFoo`, which mermaid proper
rejects. `classdiagram-v2` is recognised.

## How the renderer works

Edges accumulate as **direction bits** per cell (`U`/`D`/`L`/`R`) rather than
glyphs, so crossings and junctions resolve correctly regardless of draw order;
`finalizeMask` turns bits into characters at the end, applying the per-cell
line style (dotted/thick). `occupied` marks box interiors that edge bits must
not overwrite. Cells also carry a `tag` — the space-joined author classes of
the node that painted them, stamped via `curTag` the way `curStyle` stamps
line style — which `toLines` splits runs on and emits as `Span.classes`.

Layout is Sugiyama-shaped: longest-path ranking over the DAG (back edges
dropped by DFS colouring), barycenter reordering within ranks to cut crossings,
then barycenter relaxation for cross-axis positions. Edges between adjacent
ranks share horizontal **bus** rows; skip and multi-rank back edges route
around the diagram through vertical **lanes**, packed shortest-span-innermost
so exits and entries cross as few live lanes as possible. TD/BT lanes run on
*both sides*: an edge takes the side its endpoints lean toward (mean order
fraction within their ranks), left lanes shift the whole diagram right and
keep a label strip between lanes and content; a node serving both sides
keeps the right corridor. A forward skip
(TD/BT) splits off the source's bottom fan — its departure is a bus span, so
endpoint sharing folds it onto the siblings' row for one `┴` origin — and
enters the target's *top*; when its entry column crosses no intermediate box
it drops straight down and skips the lane entirely, else it rides the lane
and re-enters along a reserved approach row above the target's arrival
heads. A node's top entries (forward cluster + skips) spread evenly across
the box top, an aligned forward arrival pinned to centre so chains stay
straight; a label that does not fit before the next entry renders left of
its arrowhead. LR/RL skips run straight through when the target's row is
clear of intermediate boxes (right-side fan split, merged arrival), else
the bottom lane; same-row skips always lane. Back edges exit and enter
through the *sides*, which keeps returns recognisable. An *adjacent-rank*
back edge
returns locally through its band instead (TD/BT only — LR boxes are three
rows tall, no room to attach off the centre row), attached right of centre
with the band's first row reserved for its arrowhead: the lane detour cut
through sibling boxes. Track packing lets edges sharing an endpoint reuse one
row, which is why a merge draws a single arrowhead. Parallel edges (same
from/to) ride the same cells; their labels join (`one / two`) before sizing.
A `<-->` source head draws outside the border (no tee), mirroring the target
head. An arrival label clipped on the right flips left of its arrowhead when
it fits there whole (`placeLabelSided`).

`BT`/`RL` reuse the `TD`/`LR` layout and flip the finished canvas, so text is
never mirrored — `flipHorizontal` reverses each text run back to reading
order, glyph remapping skips text/edgeLabel/title cells, and under `dir: up`
the box/compartment/frame draw fns emit multi-row content upside down so the
flip restores it.

Subgraphs recurse: each is laid out into its own canvas, then blitted into a
framed box in its parent scope. An edge is drawn in the innermost scope holding
both endpoints; one crossing a boundary attaches to the *node inside* when a
blank straight corridor runs between the frame border and the node
(`buildScope` returns per-node rects, `EdgeInner` carries them to the outer
scope's routing, `openCorridor` scans columns/rows across the node's span,
releases the blit-occupied cells and pierces the border; `Canvas.junction`
merges bits into blitted glyphs since `blit` drops mask). Anything in the
way — including the frame title, which refuses piercing — falls back to the
frame attachment. Inner-annotated edges reserve a conservative full-span bus
track: the attach column is only known after placement. A subgraph
`direction` statement (`Group.dir`, TB/TD/LR only) overrides the scope's
layout direction when the root is unflipped — flips are whole-canvas, so a
flipped ancestor would mirror a differently-oriented sub-canvas — and, as in
mermaid, only when no node inside links outside the subgraph (`crossed`).

Class and ER compartments live on `Node.sections` (title / attrs / methods
rows, pre-formatted by the parser); `layoutClass` draws them verbatim. The
title row centres, the rest left-align.

## Deliberate deviations from upstream

- **`maxWidth` is gone; `width` is reported instead** (post-cutoff). Upstream
  folds the viewport decision into `render`; see *Public API*.
- **Every grammar is lenient and caps truncate** (post-cutoff, supersedes the
  salvage retry). Upstream refuses a strict-grammar diagram on one unreadable
  statement and any diagram over a cap. See *Syntax errors*.
- **Headers match exactly.** Upstream's prefix test accepts junk like
  `stateDiagramFoo`; mermaid proper does not.
- **Width is measured in painted cells, not allocated ones.** Some upstream
  layouts leave the rightmost column blank, so a diagram that fits was
  declared too wide.
- **Grapheme clusters measure and paint as one unit** (post-cutoff). Fixes
  emoji and combining sequences overflowing their boxes; `Intl.Segmenter`
  replaced ~60 lines of hand-written clustering. Standalone zero-width
  characters are dropped rather than given a cell.
- **Box outlines are `border`, not `edge`.** Upstream classifies box corners as
  border and the sides as edge, which renders every box two-tone under any
  theme where the two differ.
- **Empty outer canvas rows are omitted.** Interior empty rows remain and emit
  no spans.
- **Literal control characters are stripped at both entry points.** They
  measure one column and paint none; NUL collides with the `CONT` sentinel;
  ESC injects ANSI into scrollback.
- **Semantic span roles** instead of ratatui `Line`/`Span` + `MermaidStyles`.
- **`:::` tags and `class`/`classDef` statements are captured, not mishandled.**
  Upstream corrupts the parse everywhere `:::` can appear (drops the edge in
  `A:::x --> B`, leaks the tag into state names, declares `Animal:::hot`);
  the port attaches the class to its node in every grammar and surfaces
  `classDef`s.
- **Composite states are framed, not flattened.** `state X { ... }` becomes a
  `Group` drawn by the subgraph frame machinery; `--` splits a composite into
  unlabelled sibling regions; `[*]` is scoped per group. Upstream hoists the
  contents to the top level, which is structurally wrong.
- **Flowchart v2 `@{shape: ..., label: ...}` nodes parse.** Upstream keeps a
  bare-id node and drops the rest of the statement. Shape names fold onto the
  three silhouettes (`AT_SHAPES`; unknown means rect).
- **Sequence activations double the lifeline.** `->>+` / `-->>-` and
  `activate`/`deactivate` drive per-participant spans, drawn as `║` (message
  junctions `╟` `╢` `╫` via the double-tee pass) between the activating and
  deactivating rows — two rails, echoing mermaid's slim activation rectangle;
  an unclosed span runs to the bottom. Upstream strips the markers.
- **Diamond nodes get double borders** (post-cutoff). `A{...}` and state
  `<<choice>>` draw `╔═╗`; upstream draws them identically to `round`, an
  inert distinction. Double lines carry no direction bits — the sides are
  painted directly and `finalizeMask` resolves edge tees into the mixed
  glyphs (`╤` `╧` `╟` `╢`).
- **A frontmatter `title:` is drawn**, centred above the art in the `title`
  role (post-cutoff). The only frontmatter key with terminal meaning;
  `config` styles mermaid's own renderers and is ignored.
- **Lane endpoints order last in their rank** (post-cutoff): a skip or back
  edge exits toward the lane strip, so whatever the crossing-minimiser put
  beyond its endpoints sat in the corridor and was cut through.
- **The source box expands tabs** to 4-column stops (post-cutoff): a literal
  tab measures one cell here but jumps to the terminal's tab stop there, so
  the frame misaligned. `Canvas.set` paints any tab as a space for the same
  reason (post-cutoff), covering every diagram label path.
- **A note left of the first participant gets its own margin** (post-cutoff):
  the diagram shifts right instead of the note painting over the lifelines.
- **YAML frontmatter is skipped**, not mistaken for a header (post-cutoff);
  upstream renders the source box for any frontmattered diagram.
- **Four diagram types upstream never had** (post-cutoff): `pie` (labelled
  bar list with eighth-block precision), `mindmap` (TUI tree guides; parses
  raw lines since indentation is the grammar), `timeline` (vertical
  period/event list, sections as headers), `gitGraph` (`git log --graph`
  lanes, newest on top; connector rows go through the direction bits so
  merges crossing a lane draw `┼`). They draw rows straight onto a Canvas —
  no Sugiyama involved.
- **Cardinalities sit at their own edge ends.** ER and class relations carry
  `cardFrom`/`cardTo` beside `label`; forward routes paint each at its end
  with the verb between (TD rank gaps grow to 3 rows to make space), lanes
  and self-loops fall back to the joined string. `0..*` shortens to `*`.
  Upstream folds everything into one mid-edge string, so nothing says which
  end a number belongs to. ER aliases are also parsed quote-aware, so
  `a["Bank Account"]` renders instead of failing.
- **2026-08-15 review fixes** (post-cutoff, `REVIEW.md`): kebab-case
  flowchart ids; `class A["Label"]`; state labels containing `-->`; state
  descriptions accumulate; sequence `-x`/`-)` need a token boundary
  (hyphenated participants work); ER quoted entity names unquote and
  unterminated aliases warn; gitGraph quoted branch names; quote-aware
  flowchart `|labels|`; bare timeline periods render; adjacent-back local
  routing; parallel-edge label joining; BT multi-row content; flips leave
  user text glyphs alone.

## Verification

The port began byte-identical to upstream: a differential harness rendered
~7180 cases through both the Rust original and this code, and commit
`617cbf3` was the fidelity cutoff — up to there, all cases matched byte for
byte. Divergence after it is deliberate and listed above. The harness itself
is retired: once improving on upstream became the point, every improvement
paid a divergence-classifier tax there, so the deviations list above is the
record and the golden files are the gate.

Its corpus survives as `test/corpus.ts` — the hand-written sources, width
and emoji edge cases, and deterministic fuzz — swept by `test/corpus.test.ts`
for what golden files cannot cover at scale: `render` never throws, `styled`
reconstructs `plain`, `width` is the widest row, `sourceBox` frames anything.

## Width handling

**The grapheme cluster is the unit of both measuring and painting.** That one
decision is what keeps a box sized for exactly what gets drawn into it.

Clustering comes from `Intl.Segmenter` (UAX #29), built into Node and Bun, so
ZWJ sequences, skin-tone modifiers, variation selectors, keycaps, flags and
Hangul are handled without a table. Per-code-point widths come from the
`unicode-width` crate via `tools/width-oracle`, so they are exact by
construction rather than re-derived from the UCD.

`clusterWidth` takes the widest code point in the cluster, then forces 2 for an
emoji-presentation selector or a regional-indicator pair. Zero is a real
answer: a soft hyphen or zero-width space occupies nothing and is not painted.

The Rust original instead sizes with `UnicodeWidthStr` (which clusters) and
paints with `UnicodeWidthChar` (which does not), so `👨‍👩‍👧` is sized for 2
columns and painted into 8 — it overflows its own border. Splitting those two
notions is what the port dropped.

## Known limits (shared with upstream)

- **`sourceBox` can exceed its `maxWidth`.** The body chunks to
  `max(8, maxWidth - 4)`, and the ` mermaid: <kind> ` title is never truncated,
  so a long first token sets a floor. It reports its own `width`, so a caller
  that cares can check. Left as-is: nothing useful renders that narrow.
- **An HTML entity in an unquoted label truncates the statement.**
  `splitStatements` treats `;` outside double quotes as a statement separator,
  so `A -->|go&#160;| B` splits mid-entity and the edge is dropped. Quoting the
  label works; mermaid proper wants special characters quoted anyway.

## Porting notes

- **`noUncheckedIndexedAccess` is off.** Rust distinguishes `chars[i]` (panics,
  so always guarded) from `chars.get(i)` (returns `Option`, branched on). TS's
  `arr[i] === undefined` reproduces the `.get()` case exactly, and the guarded
  cases are already guarded.
- **Saturating arithmetic.** Rust `usize` never goes negative; `saturating_sub`
  is spelled `sat(a, b)` here.
- **Integer division.** `half()` and `Math.ceil` stand in for `/ 2` and
  `div_ceil(2)`.
- **`asciiLower`/`asciiUpper`**, not `toLowerCase`. Rust's
  `to_ascii_lowercase` preserves length; `'İ'.toLowerCase()` does not, which
  would desync the offsets `parseNoteAnchor` slices with.
- **Char arrays.** Where Rust iterates `Vec<char>`, the port uses `[...s]` so
  indices are code points, not UTF-16 units.
- Control characters are written as `String.fromCharCode(n)`, never as literals
  in source — the `CONT` sentinel is NUL and would otherwise be invisible.

## Tests

129 tests. `corpus.test.ts` sweeps the retired harness’s corpus for
crash-safety and the span/width invariants; `streaming.test.ts` renders
every code-point prefix of every golden fence under the same invariants
(the states a streaming TUI actually feeds); `ansi.test.ts` snapshots the
`toAnsi` theme × classDef merge matrix as escaped SGR. The bulk of rendering behaviour is pinned by markdown golden files
in `test/cases/<type>/<name>.md`, run by `test/cases.test.ts`: each file holds
one or more ```mermaid fences, each followed by a ```text fence with the
expected `plain` (or a bare `(null)` line for sources that must refuse) and an
optional ```warnings fence (absent = no warnings expected). GitHub renders the
mermaid fences, so each file doubles as an official-mermaid vs our-art gallery.
`bun run test:update` (repo root) rewrites the text/warnings fences from
actual output for review via `git diff`.

The programmatic suites keep what the art can't show: `test/spans.test.ts`
(span contract), `test/width.test.ts`, `test/labels.test.ts` and
`test/layout.test.ts` (unit-level), `test/parse.test.ts` (model invariants:
edge endpoints/markers, entity decoding at sinks, choice shape),
`test/render.test.ts` (classes/classDefs on spans, `diagramKind`, streaming
flip counts, caps on generated sources, width reporting, sourceBox, control
characters).

**Every discovered bug gets a regression test in the same change that fixes
it** — a golden case (`test/cases/<type>/regressions.md`) whenever the
failure shows in `plain` or `warnings`, a unit test only for what they cannot
carry (span classes, classDefs, the model, throws, widths).

## Tooling

bun (runtime + test runner + workspace), tsgo (typecheck + emit), biome
(lint + format, configured at the repo root). No runtime dependencies.
Root scripts: `test`, `test:update`, `check`, `fix`, `typecheck`,
`build`, `dev` (demo), `release` (both forward to the package); package
scripts: `build`, `gen:width`, `gen:colors`, `gen:demo`, `release`,
`prepublishOnly`.

## Releasing

Writing changelog entries and cutting the release are deliberately separate.
`/cl` only audits `## [Unreleased]` (in `packages/lovely-mermaid/CHANGELOG.md`)
against the commits since the last tag; everything mechanical lives in
`bun run release [patch|minor|major|x.y.z]` (run from `packages/lovely-mermaid`;
`--no-push` to stop at the tag), which lists any uncommitted files (refusing
only when the changelog or manifest themselves are dirty) or an empty
`[Unreleased]`, rolls the changelog over, bumps `package.json`, runs
`prepublishOnly` and `pm pack`, then pauses with the rolled changelog and
bump still uncommitted for review — one yes covers commit, tag and push
(the point of no return) — then waits for CI to
stage the version on npm and approves it with a prompted 2FA code
(`npm stage approve --otp`; stage ids are UUIDs from `npm stage list --json`).
Being a script rather than an agent is what makes its unattended push
acceptable — and the OTP prompt keeps the actual publish manual.

That tag push is the only trigger for `publish.yml` (tags with a prerelease
suffix are skipped). It checks the tag against the package's `package.json`,
runs check, typecheck, test and build as explicit steps (build and the staging
step run with `working-directory: packages/lovely-mermaid`), then **stages**
the package (`npm stage publish`) through npm trusted publishing with OIDC and
`--provenance`; `--ignore-scripts` keeps `prepublishOnly` from repeating that
work. Staging is what reconciles provenance with a human gate: CI's OIDC build
carries the attestation, but the version only becomes installable after a
maintainer approves it with 2FA. The trusted publisher on npm must be
restricted to stage-only so a compromised workflow cannot publish directly —
and it must be (re)created for the `lovely-mermaid` package name; the old
`grok-mermaid` publisher does not carry over. A second job creates the GitHub
Release with the notes sliced out of `CHANGELOG.md`, gated on the staging
succeeding. A version already on npm is skipped rather than failing, which is
what lets a release that died partway be re-run; a staged but unapproved
version is invisible to that check and fails the re-stage instead.

The push is therefore the point of no return — hence the pre-commit
confirmation, and `--no-push` for stopping short of it entirely.
Release actions and tool versions are pinned.

npm's trusted publisher matches on the workflow **filename**, so renaming
`publish.yml` silently breaks publishing: the OIDC exchange finds nothing, npm
falls back to the empty `_authToken` that `setup-node` writes, and the registry
answers `PUT` with a 404 rather than a 403. A 404 on publish means unauthorized,
not missing.
